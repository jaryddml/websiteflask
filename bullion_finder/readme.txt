This is another version of my website/webscraper. Both are run on flask and on a gunicorn server.

As of now the functionality of the scraper is that it scrapes all product data on the website instead of the users search input.
The idea is to put all the data onto a postgreSQL server that the end user will query instead of the scrapers running the search params. 
Possible future functionality: Re impliment sorting by price, filter options.
